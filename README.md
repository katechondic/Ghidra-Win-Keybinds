# Ghidra-Win-Keybinds
Providing Ghidra better accessibility through some more natural keybinds that more closely resemble IDA.


The "work" (if you can call it that) is heavily inspired by Jeremy Blackthorne's Ghidra Keybindings repo: https://github.com/JeremyBlackthorne/Ghidra-Keybindings

To install:
  - download the keybindings_windows.kbxml file
  - install it by opening a Ghidra analysis Window Edit --> tool options --> keybindings --> import 


Feedback welcome!
